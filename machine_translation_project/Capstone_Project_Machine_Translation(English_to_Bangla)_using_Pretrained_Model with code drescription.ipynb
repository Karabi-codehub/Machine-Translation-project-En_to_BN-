    "**Fine-tuning** means taking a **pre-trained model** (already trained on a large general dataset) and then training it a little more on your **custom dataset** so it can adapt to your specific task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Example:**  \n",

    "**✅ Why We Use Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "- **Saves time & resources** – Training from scratch needs huge data and computation. Fine-tuning reuses the pre-trained model’s knowledge.  \n",
    "- **Better accuracy** – The model already understands general language patterns; fine-tuning adapts it to your domain (e.g., legal, medical, tech).  \n",
    "- **Works with smaller datasets** – You don’t need millions of samples; a smaller domain-specific dataset is enough.  \n",
